Force feedback (haptic) support for Flight Gear
Version 0.1
Copyright Lauri Peltonen, 2011

This program is released under GPLv2 or later.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This force feedback support consists of 4 components:
- fg-haptic or fg-haptic.exe
- force-feedback.xml
- force-feedback.nas
- ff-protocol.xml

fg-haptic or fg-haptic.exe is the main program, which 
supports force feedback devices through SDL 1.3 library.

force-feedback.xml is a configuration utility which resides
inside Flight Gear's data directory.

force-feedback.nas is a wrapper between different flight 
dynamics models etc. and the force feedback effects.

ff-protocol.xml is a generic IO protocol which fg-haptic 
uses to communicate with flight Gear.

This program has been tested with following devices by 
the author:

- Saitek Cyborg Evo Force (Linux)
  * Does not support updating effects while running
    which makes pilot/surface forces feel bad
  * All effects supported
  * Needs special kernel patch (for kernel 3.0.0)

- Gametech "Twin USB Joystick" gamepad with rumble effect (Linux)
  * Supports only stick shaker, if gain & strength are around 1.0
  * Does not have axis (so 1?) but claims to have 2

- Logitech Driving Force GT wheel (Linux)
  * Supports only constant forces
  * Really has 1 axis only, but calims to have 2


BUILDING
--------
Required libraries:
- libsdl2-dev

fg-haptic should build by running:

make fg-haptic



INSTALLATION
------------
fg-haptic(.exe) can reside anywhere on your system.

force-feedback.xml must be copied into gui/dialogs/ directory 
inside Flight Gear's data directory.

force-feedback.nas must be copied into Nasal/ directory 
inside Flight Gear's data directory.

ff-protocol.xml must be copied into Protocol/ directory
inside Flight Gear's data directory.



RUNNING
-------
First run fg-haptic(.exe).

Then launch flightgear with at least the following options:

fgfs --telnet=5401 --generic=socket,out,20,localhost,5402,tcp,ff-protocol


If FlightGear's menu is not visible, press F10 to display it.
In the Help menu you can find Force feedback options. 
Tune them to your liking and fly!

Don't worry about the "Timeout!"s spawning in the console, they
happen if the communication is too slow between fg-haptic and fgfs.
