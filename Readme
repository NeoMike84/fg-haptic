Force feedback (haptic) support for Flight Gear
Version 0.1
Copyright Lauri Peltonen, 2011

This program is released under GPLv2 or later.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This force feedback support consists of 4 components:
- fg-haptic or fg-haptic.exe
- force-feedback.xml
- force-feedback.nas
- ff-protocol.xml

fg-haptic or fg-haptic.exe is the main program, which 
supports force feedback devices through SDL 1.3 library.

force-feedback.xml is a configuration utility which resides
inside Flight Gear's data directory.

force-feedback.nas is a wrapper between different flight 
dynamics models etc. and the force feedback effects.

ff-protocol.xml is a generic IO protocol which fg-haptic 
uses to communicate with flight Gear.


BUILDING
--------
fg-haptic should build by running:

make fg-haptic



INSTALLATION
------------
fg-haptic(.exe) can reside anywhere on your system.

force-feedback.xml must be copied into gui/dialogs/ directory 
inside Flight Gear's data directory.

force-feedback.nas must be copied into Nasal/ directory 
inside Flight Gear's data directory.

ff-protocol.xml must be copied into Protocols/ directory
inside Flight Gear's data directory.

TODO: Menu item? Maybe force-feedback.nas will create that?

Some day we might have a proper installer or something 
to make installing a bit easier...



RUNNING
-------
First run fg-haptic(.exe).

Then launch flightgear with at least the following options:

fgfs --telnet=5401 --generic=socket,out,10,localhost,5402,tcp,ff-protocol


Inside Flight Gear's menu (where?) you can find Force feedback options. 
Tune them to your liking and fly!
